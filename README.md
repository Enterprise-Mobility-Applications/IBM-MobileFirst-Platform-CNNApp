"# IBM-MobileFirst-Platform-CNNApp"

<B>Since do not have a lot of time to supply detailed info, hence supplying here what I did on my CMD prompt. Hope this helps you in setting up your first Ionic IBM MobileFirst Project.

Note that I have Ionic CLI V3 installed on my machine...


CREATE IONIC Project
===========================
Use the following command:

ionic start cnnIO1 sidemenu --type=ionic1

It will create an Ionic V1 project with SIDEMENU template.

===============================================================

INSTALLING AND TESTING YOUR MOBILE App
=======================================
Now use Android Studio to generate your APK or use command prompt and pass the following command:

      ant debug

          This should generate a debug APK.



    Launch Android Emulator:
    		Find available AVDs:	android list avd
    		Launch one of them:		emulator -avd Nexus5XAPI25

Now Install the APK on Emulator or Physical Device by using the following command:

    ADB Install <b>APK FILE with absolute path</b>

LAB 05 : ADDING ADAPTERS AND CONFIGURING THEM (& THEN USE THEM, OF COURSE)
===============================================================================

Enter the following command:

  -   mfp add adapter
  It will ask for several options. Supply adequate info. I chose HTTP Adapter.

  Now Build your project......

  -   mfp bd    // Build and Deploy.

  Since the above command is deprecated in MFP version 8.0, use the following going forward. Mind that this command will take more time compared to the above.

  -   mfp push

  Now you can view the adapter(s) on MFP Web Console. To launch the Web Console simply pass the following command.....

  -   mfp console


Now You would like to test your Adapter. Right?

  Use the following command.....

  -   mfp invoke

        This will list all available adapters and you need to choose which one you want to execute.



Now Navigate to ./apps/<YOUR APP> and add a new environment by passing the following command.

  -   mfp add environment

  It will ask you to select the environment. Select "Desktop Browser web page". This will help develop/test your mobile application much faster.

<h1>REFACTOR: Renamed Remote GITHUB Branches to suit future LAB COMMITS in better and systematic manner.</h1>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can't directly rename a remote branch. You have to delete it and then re-push it.

Something like :

  #rename the local branch to the new name

          git branch -m old_name new_name

  #delete the old branch on remote - where <remote> is eg. origin

          git push <remote> --delete old_name

  #push the new branch to remote

          git push <remote> new_name



Important note :

When you use the "git branch -m (move)", git is also updating your tracking branch with the new name.

        git remote rename regacy legacy

git remote rename is trying to update your remote section in your config file. It will rename the remote with the given name to the new name, but in your case it did not find any, so the renaming failed.

But it will not do what you think, it will rename your local config remote name and not the remote branch.
